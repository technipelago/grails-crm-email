== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer relationship management
Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Email Composition Plugin

This {gr8crm} plugin provides services, controllers and views for composing and sending emails in a {gr8crm} application.
The email composition screen can display a list of FreeMarker templates that can be selected to quickly compose standard emails.
Attachments are also supported, both uploaded local files and files stored in the application by the link:../crm-content/index.html[crm-content] plugin.

== CrmEmailService

=== Send email

+String prepareForSendMail(HttpServletRequest request, Map params)+

To send an email with the +crm-email+ plugin you create a *send configuration* and pass it to the mail composition page.
The composition page uses the configuration to initialize fields, templates and attachments.

[source,groovy]
.MyOrderController.groovy
----
def sendmail(Long id) {
    def contact = crmContactService.getContact(id) // <1>
    def user = crmSecurityService.getUserInfo()    // <2>
    def token = crmEmailService.prepareForSendMail(request, [
        tenant : TenantUtils.tenant,
        user   : user,
        referer: createLink(action: "show", id: id),
        senders: ["${user.name} <${user.email}>", "My Company Inc. <info@mycompany.com>"],
        from   : "${user.name} <${user.email}>",
        to     : "${contact.name} <${contact.email}>",
        subject: "Order Confirmation",
        body   : "Hi $contact, I'm pleased to let you know that your order has been confirmed."
    ]) // <3>
    redirect mapping: 'crm-mail-send', id: token // <4>
}
----
<1> In this example we lookup a customer (contact) that we want to send email to
<2> The current user will be the sender
<3> This creates an email configuration that is stored in the user's session
<4> Redirect to the generic sendmail page, there the user can finish the message and send it

==== Multiple recipients

The above code example opens the email composition screen and send the email to *one* recipient.
Combined with the http://grails.org/plugin/selection[selection] plugin we can compose an email the same way
and send to a *group of recipients*.

It works like this: The user searches for a group of recipients using a standard query form. When the result page is displayed
with the matching list of recipients, the user clicks a button to invoke the email composition screen to send to the group.

You must have a controller action that prepares a *send configuration* then redirects to the email composition screen.
You store the last executed query (encoded as a URI) in the send configuration (key=selection).
The query will be re-executed by `CrmEmailService` and each recipient will receive an individual copy of the email.

[source,groovy]
.MyOrderController.groovy
----
def sendmail() {
    def selection = params.getSelectionURI() // <1>
    def user = crmSecurityService.getUserInfo()    // <2>
    def token = crmEmailService.prepareForSendMail(request, [
        tenant   : TenantUtils.tenant,
        user     : user,
        referer  : createLink(action: "index"),
        senders  : ["${user.name} <${user.email}>", "My Company Inc. <info@mycompany.com>"],
        from     : "${user.name} <${user.email}>",
        selection: selection,
        subject  : "GR8 CRM News",
        body     : "Hi $m, I'm pleased to let you know that the crm-email plugin now can send to a group of recipients."
    ]) // <3>
    redirect mapping: 'crm-mail-send', id: token // <4>
}
----
<1> When using the selection plugin we can get the last executed query encoded as a URI
<2> The current user will be the sender
<3> This creates an email configuration that is stored in the user's session
<4> Redirect to the generic sendmail page, there the user can finish the message and send it to all people in the collection/selection
